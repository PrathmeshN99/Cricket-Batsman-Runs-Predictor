Tools and Technology:

Python 
Espncricinfo and https://cricsheet.org/ for dataset
CSV format for dataset
HTML,CSS,Javascript for website designing
Jupyter notebook, Visual Studio Code

Machine learning algorithms - Linear Regression,Random forest regressor, Lasso regression, k-nearest neighbors algorithm
Numpy,seaborn,pickle,pandas and sklearn libraries

Created a batsman runs predictor website by employing various machine learning algorithms and data mining.
